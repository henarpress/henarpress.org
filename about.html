        <h1>About Henar Press</h1>
        
        <h2>What's the story behind Henar Press?</h2>
        <p>Growing up in the Kurdish diaspora, I often felt a disconnect between my cultural heritage and the literature I read. As the child of Kurdish refugees who fled Saddam's Anfal campaign, I saw firsthand the impact of persecution on our language and culture. My parents, like many Kurds, were denied the opportunity to learn to read and write in Kurdish. This legacy of oppression has contributed to a scarcity of contemporary Kurdish literature, even in Kurdistan itself. My search for Kurdish books and connection to my roots took me across several countries, but it wasn't until I discovered Kareem Abdulrahman's translation of Bakhtiyar Ali's "I Stared at the Night of the City" in 2016—the first Kurdish novel to be translated into English—that I felt a sense of recognition. Reading about Sulaimani, a city where I spent part of my childhood, was a powerful experience that sparked a new sense of purpose: to share Kurdish literature with a wider audience.</p>

        <p>Today, Henar Press is a nonprofit, independent publishing press dedicated to bringing Kurdish voices to the forefront of literature. We aim to bridge the gap between Kurdish authors and English readers by translating, publishing, and promoting Kurdish literature. Our mission is to ensure that Kurdish stories are heard and celebrated.</p>

        <h2>Who are the Kurds?</h2>
        <p>The Kurds are an indigenous people with a rich cultural heritage, spanning across Turkey, Iraq, Iran, and Syria. For centuries, we have faced persecution and marginalization at the hands of ruling powers, from the Ottoman Empire's forced assimilation policies to the Ba'athist regime's campaigns of ethnic cleansing in Iraq. In Turkey, our language and culture were banned for decades, and even today, Kurdish activists and politicians face imprisonment and oppression. Yet, despite these efforts to erase our identity, we have maintained a strong determination to preserve our languages, traditions, and customs. We continue to speak our languages, celebrate our festivals, and pass down our stories and histories.</p>

        <h2>What does "Against Forgetting, We Write" mean?</h2>
        <p>Our motto, "Against Forgetting, We Write," is a testament to the power of literature in the face of erasure and oppression. For centuries, Kurdish culture and language have been banned, censored, and marginalized. We write to remember, to resist, and to reclaim our stories, our language, and our history. We write to honor the memories of the Halabja massacre, the Anfal campaign, the ongoing ethnic cleansing, and the countless Kurdish writers imprisoned and killed for their words.</p>

        <h2>Do all Kurds speak the same language?</h2>
        <p>While Kurdish is often referred to as a single language with multiple dialects, the differences between these dialects are so significant that it's accurate to consider them distinct languages. From Kurmanji to Sorani and Pehlewani, each has its own unique character and history. We aim to publish Kurdish literature that represents the many languages we speak and showcases the rich linguistic diversity of the Kurdish people.</p>

        <h2>I'm a Kurdish writer. Where can I submit my work?</h2>
        <p>We're excited to read your work! Henar Press is interested in publishing a wide range of genres, including novels, novellas, memoirs, poetry, chapbooks, and hybrid forms. We encourage experimentation and innovation. Please visit our contact page to learn more about our submission process. We welcome works in any language and will work with translators to bring your stories to a global audience.</p>

        <h2>I'm interested in reading more Kurdish literature. Where can I find it?</h2>
        <p>We're working on developing a comprehensive dataset of Kurdish literature available in English. Stay tuned for updates! In the meantime, explore our catalogue to discover new voices from Kurdistan.</p>

        <h2>How can I support Henar Press and its mission?</h2>
        <p>As a nonprofit organization, Henar Press relies on the support of readers and donors like you. By making a tax-deductible donation, you'll be helping us to continue our work of publishing and promoting Kurdish writers. We're grateful for your support and look forward to sharing our publications and events with you.</p>

        <h2>How can I stay updated on news from Henar Press?</h2>
        <p>Stay connected with us by signing up for our quarterly newsletter! It's the best way to stay up-to-date on our latest publications, events, and initiatives, and to be part of a community that's passionate about Kurdish culture and literature.
